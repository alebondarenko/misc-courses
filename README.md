# Some Comp-Ling / NLP courses offered at Potsdam

You can find an overview of our teach [on our main website](http://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/teaching/). Some of the classes mentioned there have their own repositories. This repo collects information about those that don't (and only exist in our internal course management system).
