*NLP Pragmatics  CLP Group, U Potsdam, Summer 2022*

## Agenda for the Reading Group on "NLP Pragmatics", Summer 2022, CLP Group

### Overview

This is an internal, bi-weekly reading group led by the Foundations of Computational Linguistics group.
Participation is open for interested students and researchers, please contact jana . goetze @ uni-potsdam.de.

The broad topic of this reading group is *NLP Pragmatics*: we want to get an overview of how pragmatic aspects are incorporated in current NLP models in both discourse and dialog.

### Technicalities

**Day and time:** We meet every other Tuesday, 1-2 pm, even weeks, see dates below.

**Place:** We meet in the meeting room in II.14.2 (Golm, building 14, 2nd floor). If the weather is nice, we may decide to go outside.

**Setup:**

- Everyone is expected to have read the week's readings. In addition, the background readings may be of help for context.

- In the shared google doc, post questions *before* the meeting: Questions could be about unclear arguments in the reading, or about content, or about things you want to discuss.

- Bring notes about reviewing aspects of what you have read: How would you summarize the paper? What are the strengths and weaknesses? What are possible limitations that the authors might not have mentioned?
