*CLP Reading Group, U Potsdam, Summer 2022*

This is an internal, weekly reading group led by the Foundations of Computational Linguistics group.
Participation is open for interested students and researchers.

This is a reading group with two threads:

- [HRI & Language](ss22-hri-lang-reading-group.md)

- [NLP Pragmatics](ss22-nlp-prag-reading-group.md)

The reading group happens weekly on Tuesdays, 1â€“2pm, with the topics alternating.

We meet in the meeting room in II.14.2 (Golm, building 14, 2nd floor). If the weather is nice, we may decide to go outside.

Please check the links above for more details and an agenda for the two topics.
