*HRI & Languagae CLP Group, U Potsdam, Summer 2022*

*2022-05-12: Intro from JG and first papers added*

## Agenda for the Reading Group on "HRI & Language", Summer 2022, CLP Group

### Overview

This is a bi-weekly reading group led by the Foundations of Computational Linguistics group.
Participation is open for interested students and researchers, please contact kontogiorgos@uni-potsdam.de.

The broad topic of this reading group is *HRI & Language*: we want to get an overview of the HRI literature that relates to dialogue and the use of language as main means for interaction.

### Technicalities

**Day and time:** We meet every other Tuesday, 1-2 pm, odd weeks, see dates below (alternating with the [NLP Pragmatics](ss22-nlp-prag-reading-group.md) reading group).

**Place:** We meet in the meeting room in II.14.2 (Golm, building 14, 2nd floor). If the weather is nice, we may decide to go outside by the library.

**Setup:**

- Everyone is expected to have read the week's readings. In addition, the background readings may be of help for context.

- Bring notes about reviewing aspects of what you have read: How would you summarise the paper? What are the strengths and weaknesses? What are possible limitations that the authors might not have mentioned?
